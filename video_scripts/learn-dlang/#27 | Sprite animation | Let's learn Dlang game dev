#26 | Drawing a player | Let's learn Dlang game dev

Hello and welcome. In this video we are going to implement sprite animation. I 
am going to use the textures I found on the internet. You find them in the 
asserts folder in the git repo. 

In the next video we are going to implements player movement and basic
