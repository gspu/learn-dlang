#0 | Introduction | Let's learn DLang game dev

Hi and welcome to this series of learning game development in D programming language.
D language succesfully combines high-level constructs of modern programming languages
simultaneously retaining low-level features of of C/C++ programming language. Therefore,
in my opinion, D is a perfect fit for game development. 

In this tutorial series we will learn how to write 2D games in D programming language. We
will start by learning the basics of D language by writing simple games such as Hangman, 
Tic Tac Toe and Battleship. This games will be run from the terminal. Once we get comfortable
with the language, we will start making 2D games using raylib graphics library. 

At first, we will create a graphical version of our Tic Tac Toe game just to get aquanted 
with the library, then we will do a snake game, and finally, a simple Rogue-like game or a
platformer containing a main menu, settings and a few levels.

You will need a DMD compiler, DUB package manager and any text editor. In the next video
I will show how to install each of the software. Have a nice day!
