Fractals | Mandelbrot Fractal

Hello and welcome back. Today we are going to implement the 
Mandelbrot fractal. I will also show you how to implement zooming and 
camera movements. 

I am going to use D programming language and Raylib graphics library. But
I will also upload the C version as well. The intrinsic logic is identical 
though. So, you shouldn't have any problems following me in a language
of your choice. 

I have already created a new project. All it does at the moment is opening
an empty window. 

Let's move on to the Mandelbrot Set. 

// explain theory

// onto coding
Firstly, we need to create some 
preliminary variables.
