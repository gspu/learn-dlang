Fractals | Mandelbrot Fractal

Hello everybody and welcome. Today we are going to implement the 
Mandelbrot fractal. I will also show you how to implement zooming and 
camera movements. 

I am going to use D programming language and Raylib graphics library. But
I will upload the C version as well. The intrinsic logic is identical 
though. So, you shouldn't have any problems following me in a language
of your choice. 

I have already created a new project. All it does at the moment is open
an empty window.

Mandelbrot fractal is basically a set of complex numbers, which are 
constructed on a complex plane and which we will visualize in a 2D plane. As 
a result, we get this amazing pattern. 

So, how does it work? If you do some research you will find that Mandelbrot 
set is a simple function of the form f(x) = z^2 + c, which we iterate
through starting from z = 0, where c is complex number that I will explain in
a moment. 

The idea behind it is simple. We iterate throught the function and check 
whether it's value vanishes at infinity. And then we draw each pixel based off
the result. 

Here is an example:


// onto coding
Firstly, we need to create some 
preliminary variables.
