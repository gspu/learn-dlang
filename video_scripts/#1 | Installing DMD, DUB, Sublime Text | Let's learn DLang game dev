#1 | Installing DMD, DUB, Sublime Text | Let's learn DLang game dev

Welcome back. In this video we are going to install the D compiler, DMD, Sublime Text editor,
and DUB package manager.

Let's start with the DMD compiler. Go to the dlang.org, the official D website, click on the
"Downloads" and download the official installer for the DMD compiler. There are 3 compilers
available. In general, the GDC and LDC offer advanced optimization and faster executables, 
however, the DMD compiler is the official implementation of the language. It is developed 
by the D community itself, hence, it is updated first and offers the latest featuers. For
what we plan to do, DMD is a great starting point. 

Next, let's install Sublime Text. Go to the sublimetext.com. Click on "Download", choose 
your platform and install Sublime Text. 

Finally, we need to install DUB. DUB is the official package manager for D applications 
and libraries. The main purpose of DUB is to simplify the development process. It is 
especially useful when you need an external library. It will fetch, download and build 
the required libraries itself.

To install DUB, navigate to github.com/dlang/dub/releases, choose your platform and
download the official installer.

In the next video, we will create our first program, we will learn how to use the
Terminal, output text to the terminal window, compile and run our program. Have a nice day!
