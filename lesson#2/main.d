//	This is a comment, it is ignored by the compiler
//	It is useful to comment some pieces of your code. 
//	For example, instead of reading somebody's code, you could read a comment, which explains what that code does

//	Before we start coding something interesting, we need to include a library for basic functionality.
//	A library is a collection of reusable code written by somebody else. 
//	This way we do not need to write the same code every time. It is written and stored in a library for us to use. 
//	A library provides some basic functionality such as getting input from user, outputting text to screen, 
//	reading from files etc.

//	To include and use a library use keyword 'import [library name]'
import std.stdio; //	handles data input and output

//	Our main function. Whenver you launch your program, it starts executing instructions from the main function. 
//	A function is a group of statements that performs a certain task.
void main() { 
	writeln("Hello, Dlang!"); //	outputs text to terminal/console
}
